## 🌟 Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of a self-designed data structure called **BIGINT** in C. The project focuses on high-precision arithmetic operations and includes utility functions for complex numbers and fractions. The primary objective is to calculate the value of π (pi) up to 10000 decimal places using the Chudnovsky algorithm.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devansh4645/BigInt_In_C.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd BigInt_In_C
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o main
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## ✨ Features
